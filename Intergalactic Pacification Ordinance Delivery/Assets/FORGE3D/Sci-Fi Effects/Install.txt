# Sci-Fi Effects 2.3

Thank you for purchasing the Sci-Fi Effects!

The downloaded package provides support for three different rendering pipelines and can be found in the root of the Assets/FORGE3D/Sci-Fi Effects/ folder:

* Sci-Fi Effects 2.3 Standard
* Sci-Fi Effects 2.3 HDRP
* Sci-Fi Effects 2.3 URP

## Installation

1. Double click the unitypackage compatible with your rendering pipeline to extract the content of the package. 
2. After the process is complete you will find its content under the Assets/FORGE3D/Sci-Fi Effects/ folder. 
3. You can safely remove unwanted unitypackages after the extraction. 

## URP 

To ensure proper output of the heat/blastwave/refraction shader, open the Universal Render Pipeline Asset and check the Opaque Texture to allow the GrabPass in the Heat shader.
Check Depth Texture to enable soft particles.
