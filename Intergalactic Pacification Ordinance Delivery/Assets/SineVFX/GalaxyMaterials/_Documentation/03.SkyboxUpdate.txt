This update includes new baked nebula Cubemaps, as well as updated shaders and new materials.
New Cubemaps are made for use in the "Stars" texture slot in material settings.



Built-in and URP:

For Built-in and URP, there are regular skybox materials, that can be plugged into Environment/Skybox Material slot.



HDRP:

For HDRP, there are still materials, but you need to use a fake sky sphere (Just a big sphere mesh, with inverted normals). Or you can just use HDRI Environment in Volume Settings.
